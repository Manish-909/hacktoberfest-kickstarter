Basic Integration:
from working_resume_processor import WorkingResumeProcessor

# Initialize processor
processor = WorkingResumeProcessor()

# Process a resume file
result = processor.process_resume("path/to/resume.txt")

if result["success"]:
    profile = result["profile"]

Web Application Integration:
import streamlit as st
from working_resume_processor import WorkingResumeProcessor

# File upload
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload Resume", type=['txt'])

if uploaded_file:
    # Save temporarily
    with open("temp_resume.txt", "wb") as f:
        f.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())
    
    # Process resume
    processor = WorkingResumeProcessor()
    result = processor.process_resume("temp_resume.txt")
    
    if result["success"]:
        profile = result["profile"]
        
        # Auto-fill form fields
        experience_level = profile["experienceLevel"]
        skills = profile["programmingSkills"]
        interests = profile["areasOfInterest"]
        
        # Display in Streamlit
        st.selectbox("Experience Level", 
                    ["beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"],
                    index=["beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"].index(experience_level))
        
        st.multiselect("Programming Skills", 
                      options=all_skills_list,
                      default=skills)
        
        st.multiselect("Areas of Interest",
                      options=all_interests_list,

üîß Skill Detection Logic
Experience Level Classification:
def determine_experience_level(resume_text):
    advanced_keywords = ['senior', 'lead', 'architect', 'principal', '6+ years']
    beginner_keywords = ['junior', 'entry', 'intern', '1-2 years']
    
    # Pattern matching for years of experience
    years_pattern = r'(\d+)[\+\s]*years?\s+(?:of\s+)?experience'
    
    # Classification logic based on keywords and years
Skills Extraction:
def extract_skills(resume_text):
    # Regex pattern matching for each skill
    for skill in SKILLS_LIST:
        pattern = r'\b' + re.escape(skill.lower()) + r'\b'
        if re.search(pattern, text_lower):
            found_skills.append(skill)
Interest Inference:
def extract_interests(resume_text, found_skills):
    # Direct keyword matching
    # Skills-to-interests mapping
    # Fullstack detection (frontend + backend skills)
    # Open source involvement detection
